h1. Semiotics

To get started with semiotics, we first take a look at the semiotic triangle of _Ogden and Richards_ (1923):

bc. graph {
  graph[layout=spring]
  Symbol; Referent; Reference
  Symbol -- Referent [label="Stands for" style=dashed]
  Referent -- Reference [label="Refers to"] 
  Reference -- Symbol [label="Symbolizes"]
}
